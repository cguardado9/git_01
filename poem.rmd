I see you peeking timidly    
from between the skeletal bars    
of your bleached, bony fortress,    
vibrant colors a sign of defiance    
in this scorched grayscape.    
I hear your silent exclamation     
of resurgence and rebirth.  

Your seed burrowed deep    
as the buck sheltered you    
from the raging furnace above.    
He must have been fearless,    
offering himself as sanctuary     
to your unborn, fragile beauty    
in the face of natureâ€™s fury.
